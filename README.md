# ðŸŽ¥ Aluraflix - Video Streaming Platform

## Overview
Aluraflix was the final challenge in the React course of the Alura and Oracle Next Education (ONE) program. The goal was to create a React-based API from scratch, inspired by Netflix, using only a Figma design as a reference. This project incorporates various React features and `json-server` to make the API dynamic.

## Features
- **React Framework:** Built using Vite and React.
- **Component-based Architecture:** Modular and reusable components.
- **Styled Components:** Custom styling for a modern look.
- **React Router Dom:** Enables seamless navigation between pages.
- **React Hooks:** Uses `useContext()`, `useEffect()`, and `useState()`.
- **API Interaction:** Fetches and manages data using `json-server` with GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests.
- **Form Validation:** Ensures valid input before submitting data.

## How It Works
### Adding Videos
- Users can add new videos using the "New Video" form.
- Videos are categorized and stored in the database.
- The homepage dynamically updates with new videos.

### Editing and Deleting Videos
- Videos can be edited directly from the homepage.
- Clicking "Edit" allows users to update video details.
- Clicking "Delete" removes the video from the database.
